# CDRC Semantic Search System

## Overview

The CDRC Semantic Search System is a project designed to enhance the search capabilities of the Centre for Consumer Data Research (CDRC) data catalogue. The goal is to implement a semantic search approach that goes beyond traditional keyword-based searches, providing users with more accurate and relevant results.

## Features

- **Semantic Search:** Utilizes advanced natural language processing techniques to understand the meaning behind user queries, enabling a more intuitive and precise search experience.

- **Data Catalog Integration:** Seamlessly integrates with the CDRC data catalogue, ensuring comprehensive coverage of available datasets.

- **User-Friendly Interface:** A simple and user-friendly interface makes it easy for researchers and stakeholders to interact with the system.
